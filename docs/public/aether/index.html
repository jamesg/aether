                    Aether is a plant environment monitoring system.  It
                    monitors vital attributes of your plant's environment, to
                    ensure that your plants have the best conditions in which
                    to thrive.

                    <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>
                    Aether gives you the tools to plan your plant's entire
                    lifecycle, from sowing to harvest.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Sensors</h3>
                    <p>
                    Aether records the air temperature and soil moisture
                    content to give you well-founded advice and warn you of
                    conditions that may damage your plants.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Knowledge Base</h3>
                    <p>
                    Aether is supplied with a knowledge base detailing the
                    ideal growing conditions of over two popular plant
                    varieties.  The knowledge base makes sure that Aether will
                    only give advice relevant to the varieties you choose to
                    grow, freeing you from the worry of different plant's
                    requirements and giving you more time to get on with the
                    gardening.

                    <h3>Multiple Devices</h3>

                    Access the web interface from your computer, tablet or
                    smartphone.  Aether is built with modern web standards, so
                    it works with any modern web browser.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Locally Hosted</h3>
                    <p>
                    Aether is hosted on your own home network.  An Internet
                    connection is only required for knowledge base and software
                    updates.

                    Aether can monitor several environments at once.  When you
                    first start the system, you will be asked to enter a list
                    of locations for plants; these could be your windowsill, a
                    coldframe, a South-facing wall or a vegetable patch -
                    whatever suits your garden.

                    The complete Aether system incorporates a base station and
                    one or more wireless sensors.  You place the wireless
                    sensors next to a batch of plants you want to monitor, then
                    assign the sensor to the plant's record using the web
                    interface.  Details of the plant will be displayed on the
                    sensor's LCD screen, so you know it's set up correctly.

                    You can monitor any range of environments by adding more
                    sensors.  Sensors have a typical range of 100m to the base
                    station; plenty to cover a large plot, or a plot some
                    distance from your house.

                    Aether has knowledge of over two varieties of plant, so it
                    can provide detailed advice on how to care for each and
                    every one of your plants.  Moisture and temperature
                    warnings will only be issued if they would damage the
                    particular plant being grown.

                    <h3>Weather Forecasts</h3>
                    <p>
                    As well as keeping track of the local temperature, Aether
                    can use an online weather forecast to warn you of harmful
                    weather events several days in advance.  You'll never be
                    caught out by a late frost again!  Aether can also predict
                    droughts and will tell you when to give your plants extra
                    water.
                    </p>

                    Aether knows the best time to sow, plant out and harvest
                    all the varieties in the knowledge base.  It can suggest
                    new varieties to sow each month and tell you how long you
                    can expect to wait before cropping.
