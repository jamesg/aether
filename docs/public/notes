Aether
======

A Plant Environment Monitoring System
-------------------------------------

[Lettuce]

Aether is a wireless sensor network that monitors your plant's growing
environment for soil moisture, light and temperature.  It uses a built in
knowledge base to help you tailor care to your plant's requirements.

### Components (What?)

[Block diagram]

Aether consists of two physical components: the base station, which you plug
into your home router, and a wireless, solar-powered sensor which you connect
to your plants.  The base station collects data from your plants and shows you
the data via a web interface.

### Benefits (Why?)

[Plant lifecycle]

Plants can be tricky to look after.  Different varieties have different
requirements for light, water and heat.  Aether knows the optimal conditions
for growing over 2 individual varieties of plant, so can give you tailored
advice on how to get the best from your garden.

### Installation (How?)

[Sensor]

To get started, plug the base station into your home network and place the
sensor next to your plants.  Use the web interface to create a new 'batch';
this is the unit of plants monitored by the sensor.  Tell Aether where the
plants are so that it understands their exposure to the weather.  Aether can
then give adivce on when to water your plants.

### Wireless Capabilities (Where?)

The wireless sensor has a range of about 100 metres and is designed to be
placed outdoors.  You can access the web interface from your home on any
desktop, tablet or mobile phone with a web browser.

### Plant Lifecycle (When)?

[Calendar]

Aether's 'plant lifecycle' feature can monitor several environments at once.
For instance, you might start off seedlings on a windowsill, move them on to a
greenhouse and then plant them out in the garden.  Aether monitors the
conditions at each location to understand how they relate to the weather
forecast; for instance, it will learn that your greenhouse is hotter than the
weather forecast predicts, while a cold frame may be cooler.

Aether is aware of the seasons, and can suggest which new varieties you should
sow at any time of year.  With a comprehensive knowledge base, there's always a
new variety waiting for you to try!

### Summary

Features:

* Install on your home network - no reliance on an external service.
* Weather warnings powered by Internet weather forecast data.
* Knowledge base with data on over 2 varieties of plant.
* Robust, wireless, solar-powered sensor.
* Variety information is displayed on each sensor.

### Technical Information

Aether is open source, so you can adapt the code to suit your own needs or use
the code to assemble your own system from scratch.
